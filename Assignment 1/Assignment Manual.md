# Solidity Fundamentals

## Instructions:
You can save the code in notepad and save it with `.sol` extension, create a zip folder and upload it on moodle. You can solve Question 1, 2 and 3 in a single contract. These transactions must be done through Metamask. 
Question 4 and 5 must be in 2 separate contracts and these transactions can be done in Remix environment.
Also, comment yout code for readability.

## Practical Part
### Question 1 
Write a function which takes 5 numbers and returns the average of them (only 5 number).
