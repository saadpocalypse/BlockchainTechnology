# Activity 3

Create a struct of type Person, which has details of that person such as
* Name
* gender
* Birth year
* major

You need to create 3 separate functions for the following actions:
1. Adding values to the structure.
2. Returning these values (you will have to create 4 different return functions).
3. Adding values through mapping (you will have to create mappings of type uint
to Person).

<hr>

Note: Uint in Function 3 can be CNIC number (without hyphens).
