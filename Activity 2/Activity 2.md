# Activity 2

Write a smart contract that has a single function with multiple "require" statements
which should do the following:

* if the number is divisible by 4, print appropriately.
* if the number is divisible by 2 and 4 both, print appropriately.
* if the number is not divisible by 2 and 4, print appropriately.

Note: All numbers that are divisible by 4 are divisible by 2 as well.
